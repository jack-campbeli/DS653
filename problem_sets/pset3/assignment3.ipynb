    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to learn about digital signatures, hash functions, and the structure of a blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we introduce a toy blockchain that contains many of the same concepts as used within Bitcoin, but with some components removed (like the mining rewards, transaction fees, scripting language, and adjustments to the difficulty level).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python classes\n",
    "Our toy blockchain is written as Python code, which we provide below. We separate the blockchain into four classes:\n",
    "- The `TransactionPayload` class holds the relevant information for a single payment: the sender and receiver (identified by their public keys) and the amount of money being transferred.\n",
    "- The `Transaction` class contains the payload together with a digital signature made by the sender.\n",
    "- The `Block` class contains the block \"height\" (which is just a 0-indexed counter), a set of new transactions, and a pointer to the previous block in the chain. Additionally, the block contains a `nonce` that can be chosen arbitrarily by the block's miner in order to satisfy the difficulty rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `blockchain` object is a list of blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this assignment, the difficulty rule is that:\n",
    "> _The hash of a valid block must begin with 8 bits (one byte) of all 0s_.\n",
    "\n",
    "To instantiate these Python classes, execute the code blocks below."
